 # Digital-Library-System
 This application has been designed to assist students, librarians and teachers to access books from a vast catalogue we have in our system and also add new titles to expand the collection. 

 The menu has these options/features to choose from:
    1. Add a Book
    2. View All Books 
    3. Search a Book (You can input either BookID or Title)
    4. Update Book Details
    5. Delete a Book
    6. Exit
For adding a booktitle just press 1 and you will be able to enter the book details like BookID, Title, etc. The instructions are similar for other options.
